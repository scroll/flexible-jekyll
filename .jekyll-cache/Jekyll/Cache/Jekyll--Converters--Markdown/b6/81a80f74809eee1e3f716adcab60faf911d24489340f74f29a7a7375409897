<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>* For the length of this post, we will draw analogy between
companies and machines consisting of small parts. If you don‚Äôt like this analogy
just substitute it with any of the following:*</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Company is Organism with Cells.</em></li>
  <li><em>Company is Ecosystem with Organisms.</em></li>
  <li><em>Company is Dependency Graph with Nodes.</em></li>
  <li><em>Or if you are functional programming fan ‚Äî Company is a Program with Functions.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>The point is ‚Äî these are just semantics and they only help illustrate the
point, so don‚Äôt get hung up on the over-simplification here.</em></p>

<p>A Company (like a Machine) has inputs and outputs. For example, Hack and Paint‚Äôs
machine has inputs in the form of time (from people) and money (from our bank
account). The output of this machine is a VR game. Anyone who is not part of
Hack and Paint can look at Hack and Paint and draw the conclusion that it‚Äôs a
machine that takes in money and time and outputs a VR game. Pretty straight
forward. For someone outside the company that‚Äôs all the information they have‚Äî
it‚Äôs a black box machine and what happens inside of the black box is unknown to
them.</p>

<p>But for someone inside Hack and Paint, what happens inside the black box is
hugely important because it affects not only them, but also how this machine
produces VR games. It can produce them slowly, quickly, it can be optimized to
spend resources carefully and still produce the same output. Or it can be
functioning badly and it can spend all the resources without producing anything
at all. <strong>How a machine operates is determined by it‚Äôs people and it‚Äôs
culture.</strong> The people are the parts of this machine and the culture is the rules
and the logic that the machine uses to operate.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/input-output.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So companies, like machines, consist of parts that also have inputs and outputs.
In terms of Hack and Paint and because we use
Holacracy to operate this machine, these parts are roles. So far we have a big machine
with parts inside the big machine. On any given day, at any given moment a
company takes thousands, sometimes millions of decisions. From something small
and internal, like ‚Äúhow to name this variable‚Äù to something big and external,
like ‚Äúshould we buy our competitor‚Äù. Decisions happen all around us, all the
time. How these decisions are taken will determine if the company will succeed
or fail. <strong>So good decision making is kind of a big deal.</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: In self-managed companies an important principle is the principle of
transparency. Which means that all parts in this machine are free to exchange
information without restrictions. The freeer the information is allowed to flow
between parts in machines, the better. If you try to design a machine without
allowing it‚Äôs parts to share information, I can guarantee that it will be a
poorly designed machine ;)</em></p>

<p>At Hack and Paint we have a role called ‚ÄúRigger ‚Äù ‚Äî and to oversimplify it, the
input this role accepts is ‚Äúunrigged 3D model‚Äù and it outputs ‚Äúrigged 3D
character‚Äù. You can take any role in our current company governance scheme and
see very well what inputs that role (part in the machine) accepts and what
outputs it produces.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/input-output-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So if the small ‚ÄúRigger‚Äù part is given the required input ‚Äî unrigged model, it
very well knows what to do with it ‚Äî to rig it. But sometimes these parts are
given inputs they can‚Äôt really handle on their own or information gets to the
part, based on which it needs to take a decision outside the scope of it‚Äôs
design. For example the part gets information that the machine is missing
another important part ‚Äî Animator to animate the rigged character. For example
the person that has the Animator role is no longer within the company, the role
is on vacation, or otherwise absent. Which means any work done by the Rigger
part will be a waste of time. Now the part has to decide if it needs to continue to
work on the rig or to stop doing this work. So the input to that part is ‚ÄúBased
on what you know ‚Äî decide if you should rig or not rig the 3D model‚Äù.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/input-output-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs explore 3 different scenarios to gain some perspective:</p>

<h3 id="the-part-decides-to-process-this-input-without-notifying-other-parts">The part decides to process this input without notifying other parts</h3>

<p>What happens when the part decides she can process this input and stops work on
the character. If the part does this without notifying other parts in the
machine that depend on this information, chaos can ensue. Suddenly a decision
has been taken that requires information to be spread to other parts of the
machine, but that didn‚Äôt happen. So you are left with someone working on a task
that is directly affected by this decision and suddenly they are left working on
something that isn‚Äôt relevant anymore ‚Äî waste of time, resources and morale. So
to program all parts in the Hack and Paint machine to process any decisions
(inputs) that they are given, regardless of the nature of the decision, is a bit
overwhelming. This won‚Äôt work. So work will continue without the right
communication about decisions that have been taken and crucial parts of the
machine will be left in the dark ‚Äî very inefficient design for a machine, don‚Äôt
you think?</p>

<h3 id="the-part-decides-to-process-this-input-and-then-notifies-other-parts-for-the-decision">The part decides to process this input and then notifies other parts for the decision</h3>

<p>This machine design is a bit better than the first, but still not as streamlined
as it could be. Here is why. The part decides what to do with the input ‚Äî in
this case, stop work on the tasks. Then it notifies other parts about the
decision. The problem here is that some other part might have additional
information that the first part was missing and say <em>‚ÄúHey, why did you decide
this without notifying us before hand? I know a solution how to progress even
with the current situation of missing an Animator. You should have notified us
PRIOR to making this decision.‚Äù</em> Now the Rigger part is given information that
they were missing before ‚Äî that there is a way to progress, but the decision was
already taken ‚Äî so that‚Äôs just a bad timing.</p>

<h3 id="the-part-decides-to-notify-other-parts-for-the-situation-and-then-take-a-decision-based-on-their-inputs">The part decides to notify other parts for the situation and THEN take a decision based on their inputs</h3>

<p>Clearly we need a rule to handle situations where a part is given an input
outside the specification or scope of its design. For an even better machine
design, we came up with a process called ‚ÄúThe Advice Process‚Äù.
With this design/process, the part in question will FIRST determine who will get
affected by it‚Äôs decision, THEN ask for advice from the parts that will be
affected, and FINALLY will be able to take an informed decision based on their
inputs. In this design,information is sought before proceeding with important
decisions, because it affects multiple parts and the machine as a whole. The
principle here is to aim for decisions with consent (not to be mistaken with
consensus) i.e. everyone effected has given their input (and therefore their
consent) for the decision to be made knowing that all the necessary information
has been shared. This is crucial, because if all the relevant parts are not
involved in this decision, by being asked for their advice, those parts will
feel disengaged from the work. This is really important and it is embedded in
all self-management companies, in some way or another, because it is a very
elegant way of solving some extremely common issues like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decisions taken without notice</li>
  <li>decisions taken without knowledge of the whole picture</li>
  <li>taking wrong decisions altogether</li>
  <li>disengagement from work</li>
  <li>bad morale</li>
</ul>

<p>So now you have an insight as to how we use Holacracy and ‚Äúthe Advice Process‚Äù
to oil every part of our machine in the hope to make it work as well and
efficiently as possible. Self management is organic and constantly evolving and
we hope to continue sharing our leanings with you along the way. Let us know
